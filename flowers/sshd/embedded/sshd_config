#	$OpenBSD: sshd_config,v 1.104 2021/07/02 05:11:21 dtucker Exp $

# This is the sshd server system-wide configuration file.  See
# sshd_config(5) for more information.

# This sshd was compiled with PATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin

# The strategy used for options in the default sshd_config shipped with
# OpenSSH is to specify options with their default value where
# possible, but leave them commented.  Uncommented options override the
# default value.

Port {{.Port}}
#AddressFamily any
#ListenAddress 0.0.0.0

#HostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key
#HostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key

# Authentication:

LoginGraceTime 1m
PermitRootLogin no
#StrictModes yes
MaxAuthTries 2
#MaxSessions 10

#PubkeyAuthentication yes

# The default is to check both .ssh/authorized_keys and .ssh/authorized_keys2
# but this is overridden so installations will only check .ssh/authorized_keys
AuthorizedKeysFile	.ssh/authorized_keys

#AuthorizedPrincipalsFile none

#AuthorizedKeysCommand none
#AuthorizedKeysCommandUser nobody

# For this to work you will also need host keys in /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts
#HostbasedAuthentication no
# Change to yes if you don't trust ~/.ssh/known_hosts for
# HostbasedAuthentication
#IgnoreUserKnownHosts no
# Don't read the user's ~/.rhosts and ~/.shosts files
#IgnoreRhosts yes

# To disable tunneled clear text passwords, change to no here!
PasswordAuthentication no
#PermitEmptyPasswords no

# Change to no to disable s/key passwords
KbdInteractiveAuthentication no

# Kerberos options
#KerberosAuthentication no
KerberosOrLocalPasswd no
#KerberosTicketCleanup yes
#KerberosGetAFSToken no

# GSSAPI options
#GSSAPIAuthentication no
#GSSAPICleanupCredentials yes

# Set this to 'yes' to enable PAM authentication, account processing,
# and session processing. If this is enabled, PAM authentication will
# be allowed through the KbdInteractiveAuthentication and
# PasswordAuthentication.  Depending on your PAM configuration,
# PAM authentication via KbdInteractiveAuthentication may bypass
# the setting of "PermitRootLogin prohibit-password".
# If you just want the PAM account and session checks to run without
# PAM authentication, then enable this but set PasswordAuthentication
# and KbdInteractiveAuthentication to 'no'.
#
# NOTE 1: Contrary to at least Debian and Ubuntu, we (Florist) keep the OpenSSH
# default of "UsePAM no" for increased security. On the other hand, this
# breaks all SSH connections, because on Linux account passwords are disabled
# with a '!' character, and when openSSH sees a '!' in /etc/shadows, also if
# using public key authentication, it rejects the authentication. To solve
# this problem, we must replace '!' with '*' (for example, with
# "usermod -p '*' username"), which still disables password but allows public
# key. Go figure why...
# NOTE 2: This is more complicated than expected. For the time being, let's
# follow the Linux distributions approach of "UsePAM yes". This will be
# finally fixed in branch shadow-package.
